## CRITICAL: Missing Images You Need

Your website references these files but they don't exist yet:
- `images/favicon.ico`
- `images/apple-touch-icon.png`
- `images/church-og-image.jpg`

## Quick Fix Option 1: Use Online Tools (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Create Favicon
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Enter "SP" for St. Patrick's
3. Choose these settings:
   - Background: #1e3a8a (blue)
   - Font: Bold
   - Font Color: #f59e0b (gold)
4. Click "Download"
5. Extract the ZIP file
6. Upload these files to your `images/` folder:
   - `favicon.ico`
   - `apple-touch-icon.png`

### Step 2: Create Open Graph Image
1. Go to https://www.canva.com (free)
2. Create a design with dimensions: 1200 x 630 pixels
3. Add:
   - Church name: "St. Patrick's Catholic Church"
   - Subtitle: "Igbogila, Ipaja, Lagos"
   - Cross symbol or church photo
   - Use your brand colors (#1e3a8a blue and #f59e0b gold)
4. Download as JPG

2. Rename it to `church-og-image.jpg`
3. For favicon, use: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
